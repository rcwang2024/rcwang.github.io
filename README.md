# Learning by Doing

This is the repository of my scripts and articles from my journey into data science, machine learning, and even artificial intelligence. 

Tips:

- Knowledge is objective; how knowledge is handled is dynamic and variable.
  
- If you want to know whether you understand something, create something by yourself.
  
- Using output to push the input.

- The contents will be continuously updated.
