# Hello world
**This is a summary of learning Python**

## Section 1 objects in python
The structure of this part is first to explain what the objects are, the methods applied to the objects, and when to use them

### Numbers
Normally, including integers, floats.

+ integers: `1, 2, 4, 199, -3`
+ float: `0.989, 2.345`

All the mathematically reasonable calculations can be applied to numbers. for example: `+, -, *, /, %, //`

### Bools
Including **_True_**, **_False_**

+ What can be valued as **True**: "True", all the positive values, non-empty values like a string, 'python'
+ What can be valued as **False**: "False", negative and zero values, empty objects

The bool calculation includes: ``and, or, no ``

### String
It's a series of symbols that can be recognized by computers, including numbers, letters, and special symbols, embraced by ``' ', " ", """ """``

+ `'Hello, python', 'a', "b"`
+ `'2004', "+-*/"`
