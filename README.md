# Learning by Doing
This is the repository of my scripts and articles from my journey into data science, machine learning, and even artificial intelligence. 
Tips for learning:
- Knowledge is objective; how knowledge is handled is dynamic and variable.
- If you want to know whether you understand something, create something by yourself.
- Using output to push the input.
