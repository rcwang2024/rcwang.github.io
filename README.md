# Learning by Doing

This is the repository of my scripts and articles from my journey into data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 
There will be three main types of content: 

- Notes on learning skills

- Articles on my understanding of ML/DS/AI

- Projects I have done or working on

The contents will be continuously updated

Points for sharing:

> Knowledge is objective; how knowledge is handled is dynamic and variable.
  
> If you want to know whether you understand something, create something by yourself.
  
> Using output to push the input.
